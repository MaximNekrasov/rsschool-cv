Hi, my name is Maxim Nekrasov. I came to school courses in order to try to develop my programming skills, I had never done this before and had not attended any courses.

I am 32 years old. I work in a company that sells computer equipment. In discord I can be found under the nickname MaksimNekrasov (@MaximNekrasov). I am currently studying English on my own. I hope I will succeed. Thank you.
